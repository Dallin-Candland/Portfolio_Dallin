            <p>I want to start of by saying that I am aware of the turnout of indi game makers, and especially those that build 
                their own game engine. The 1 reason few people are able to make their own game is that necesity to have enduring motivation.
             That said, daydreaming about video game concepts is my passion. Even though I have no forseeable outcome, I want to at least 
             express my imagination, and create something that didn't exsist before.<br>
            Night of the SuperNatural is the code-name/project-name of my game, until a better fitting title is made. It 2 key characteristics 
            are its retro asthetics, 2D platformer RPG gameplay. The game engine would run is though it were simulating a gaming console from 
            the 90's, with the rendering capabilities between a 16-bit and a 64-bit system.</p>
            <h3>GamePlay</h3>
            <p>My all time favorite series, ever since I started gaming as a kid, were Mega Man X, Metroid, and Castlevania. I've thrown ideas 
                around of how I could combine the genres. In essence it would the game would be segmented into explorable areas, that contain 
                upgraes/abilites that are blocked by obstacles that require the use of other upgrades/abilities. Generally each area has a path 
                that ends with a boss and an upgrade/ability.
