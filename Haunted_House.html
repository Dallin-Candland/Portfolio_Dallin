            <P>This game was a major part of my childhood. It gave me nightmares,
                 and I couldn't stop playing it. It's engraved in my mind, and
                  even as an adult I still find the game to be entertaining,
                despite the outdated gameplay, visuals, sounds etc. I think if
            general audiences gave this game a try, 85% would say it was enjoyable.
        </P>
        <p>What makes this game entertaining is its replay value. Even after beating
            the game, there is still more to do, only about half of mechanics have been
            used on a first run though. There is an experimental aspect to the game.
            Learning paterns of what items interact with different room objects. It
            has a single goal, which is to collect 13 keys, with all sorts of side quests,
            so to speak. There are hidden elements that can be unlocked by reading the
            books, talking with the characters in the house. Through monsters into the mix,
            and you hit entertainment at every level.
        </p>
        <p>The game has become defunct since it has not had any updates whatsover since
            it's release. You cant even get the game to run, unless you know how to
            run windows 1993 - 1999. For a while I thought it would be great to
            redistribute the game and get it to run on current opperating system.
            I found an email for the director of the game, and sent him a message.
            We happy to have recieved a fan letter, and told me he would be willing to
            talk over zoom. We talked about his experience directing the company and working
            with the team.
            He was more than willing to share the source code, and early versions of the game.
            And here's where things ended up after that... A YouTuber created a chanel
             for posting haunted house content, and sharing secrets in the game. I was able to
             connect with him and share my interaction with the director. I told him I knew
            nothing about how to make the game run on any current platform, and he responded
             by sharing https://www.scummvm.org/. With the source code as reference, he could use this to
             rewrite the game to run on newer computers.
             It's been months since I've heard from him, still hoping that he can get this to work.

              I should mention too, that I wouldn't share announce this on a public
              domain, but the odds that any serious fans of game would find this page are slim
              to say the least. So, why not.
